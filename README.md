# C Programming Practice

Welcome to my C programming repository! This workspace contains my solutions to various algorithmic challenges, academic exercises, and fundamental programming concepts.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Currently, this repository includes:

### `recursion-1/`
[cite_start]This folder contains C programs focused on solving problems using recursive approaches[cite: 1]. Some of the implemented solutions include:
* [cite_start]Finding the maximum number in a 10-element array[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]Finding the second maximum number in a 10-element array[cite: 3].
* [cite_start]Finding the closest perfect number smaller than a given input[cite: 4].

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any of the C files in this repository, open your terminal and use the GCC compiler:

```bash
# Compile the code
gcc -o output_name recursion-1/find_second_max_recursive.c

# Run the executable
./output_name
